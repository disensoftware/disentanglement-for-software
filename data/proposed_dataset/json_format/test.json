Seems odd tonpm iinto a tmp folder in the dockerfile and then get docker-compose to copy that over into the host machine volume.

I dont know if it's some kind of conflit, but I think I have to report this, because it's a shame. The last time I had to reinstall my system, because I couldnt even start the system. This time, when I realise I had just 6GB left, I deleted some stuff here to have at least 20GB free, then disconnect from internet, restart, delete all docker images (Yes, I installed yesterday and I downloaded 4 images) then uninstall docker, and the magic happens. 100GB free right now ... Someone tells me. How this is even possibel that docker uses 100GB ? I was watching the free space decreasing. C'mon. Fix that.

So, now I have two questions:1) should I use a single n x n conv layer as input? or should I use some mega large input that contains all the n x n frames until the slowest motion is completed?2) if I used just single n x n as input, how should the training labeling be done? logically it seems that the label should be when the motion is completed, that is in the end, but should the other frames from the first to the last frame also be labeled the same?",

If you have geth version 1.4.11 you will need to use this command line after you delete the block chain and start again : geth --fast --support-dao-fork --cache=512 --maxpeers 75 --jitvm  i have had trouble when i have not used the --support-dao-fork command so try again .  I think you can't get around not downloading the whole chain before you deploy a contract  . You could try uninstalling everything and restarting the system and then reinstall Just mist but install 0.8.7 and that way i know you will have all the right programs in the right places  . However i would remove what is in the Mist folder in c:\\user\\yourusertname\\AppData\\Local\\Mist and copy the new version 0.8.8 to the Mist folder you have just deleted don't remove the folder Mist just what is inside it . You can download the new version and just unzip it to any folder you wish , it's the contents of the folder you copy and paste to your Mist folder in C:\\users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Local\\Mist . Don't run Mist until you have  replaced the Mist contents with the new versionif you do it this way don't run geth  just run Mist and let it download . If you still having trouble i would check your connection to see if it's dropping out and contact your ISP .remember if you stop it from downloading you will have to start from scratch as the second time you start it it will not download fast if you have not deleted the chain",
