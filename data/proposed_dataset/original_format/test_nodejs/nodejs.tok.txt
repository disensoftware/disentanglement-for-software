<s> <user> <unka<> > i need to test that . looks like it would work </s>
<s> <user> <unka<> > this is using fork , rather than spawn . i am afraid i do not know the difference .. and also remember to fire the send <unka> . otherwise you may not get the listener added in time </s>
<s> <user> <unka<> > let us know if it works .. as i am just guessing here .. </s>
<s> <user> <unka<> > okay just a moment </s>

<s> <user> <unka<> > <unka_> <unk#a,@_> i just do n't have time to look into it at the moment . </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a<> > ok :p </s>
<s> <user> <unka<> > <unka> : thanks !!! its working ! the message was passed from forked child process to the parent . upon recieving the message executed some work on parent process . </s>

<s> <user> <unka<> > are there any practical examples of the " <unka-> algorithm " of <unka> causing issues ? its a problem <unka> solves , but i <unka'\> think <unka\> 've ever seen or even heard of it before </s>
<s> <user> <unka<> > <unka> : no , i 've asked the <unka> team many times and nobody has yet presented one concrete example where <unka> is more deterministic than npm in a way that matters in practice . </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a<> > hi , can someone explain to me node js . i feel it is just too hacky , everything depends on something else , it seems like a falling building . no base , or an useless base that doesnt satisfy the need of a developer in the area of backend programming . you either have to depende on all these packages or you cant program anything . or maybe all of this is because i have just started to learn it </s>
<s> <user> <unka<> > <unk#a> : the packages not a must have these are helpers to make your job easier . </s>
<s> <user> <unka<> > but built-in packages are important like " fs " these are must <unk#a-.[> <unk#:> ] <unk#a<> > <unka> : not really , how do you program a general website without express ? you gonna have to route everything long way </s>
<s> <user> <unka<> > <unk#a> : what do you want to do and where are u stuck ? </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a<> > <unka> : its not a specific problem , im just learning node and i dont like that it is so hacky , really dependent on open source modules for everything </s>
<s> <user> <unka<> > <unk#a> : that is n't hacky , it is actually the entire point lol </s>
<s> <user> <unk#a<> > <unka> : yeah it is hacky , otherwise it would be stand alone </s>
<s> <user> <unka<> > <unk#a> : stand alone is an evil word , you obviously have a very different philosophy than the nodejs crowd on average </s>
