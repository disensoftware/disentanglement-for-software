[2016-12-01 11:32:22] <deepakchoudhury> I have a doubt.hide_keyboard is working great but do you know how to know if the keyboard is open or not
[2016-12-01 11:32:38] <deepakchoudhury> for andorid app
[2016-12-01 12:46:38] <pramodnaik> Hi@deepakchoudhury@deepakchoudhury: I don't think u have an option to check if keyboard is opened or not. But u can try catch the hide keyboard. If it throws exception means keyboard is already closed
[2016-12-01 13:53:26] <deepakchoudhury> Thanks@pramodnaik...its working...

[2016-12-12 05:25:26] <tekisrinivas20> Divya-tfw: can you try start apium server with override exist session..
[2016-12-12 05:25:36] <Divya-tfw> mgmanikandan87: : So now how can I delete cache data and start run ?or any other alternative for the problem
[2016-12-12 05:26:06] <Divya-tfw> override exist session ? where is that option ? Appium or shud i add in capabilit
[2016-12-12 05:27:24] <tekisrinivas20> In apium server settings u can find override exist session check box..u can check it
[2016-12-12 05:27:40] <mgmanikandan87> Rahul-Chulliparambil: are you using GUI or command line tool
[2016-12-12 05:27:40] <Divya-tfw> ok let me check
[2016-12-12 05:27:40] <mgmanikandan87> ?
[2016-12-12 05:28:18] <mgmanikandan87> Divya-tfw: override exist session means will override exit session for next run it won’t create new session
[2016-12-12 05:29:46] <Divya-tfw> Then scripts will fail I guess, as new session will be created evry time when we run scripts .Now since its over riding that if some thing fails , then it will abort execution
[2016-12-12 05:30:21] <mgmanikandan87> Divya-tfw: can you post your appium full logs here ?
[2016-12-12 05:30:50] <Divya-tfw> Logs will throw error as Element not found and continues with next script
[2016-12-12 05:32:25] <mgmanikandan87> can you post whole appium logs
[2016-12-12 05:32:42] <Divya-tfw> ok will post .Let me give run and send u
[2016-12-12 05:32:52] <mgmanikandan87> ok
[2016-12-12 05:34:36] <tekisrinivas20> In my case also I was able to run first test successfully. for second script it is failing. this solution solved for me..

[2016-12-16 15:17:51] <PeterGolf> PeterGolf: hi all!Does any one have problems with finding elements in ios application with ios driver?appium version 1.6.3i can see element on screen of devicebut when i'm making getPageSource - cant find them
[2016-12-16 21:57:31] <kidmillions> lionel-pushios: you'll want to make requests to the appium server. The easiest way to do this is with a webdriver client.
[2016-12-16 22:23:25] <lionel-pushios> thanks@kidmillionsno I was having trouble to actually run a JavaScript file to utilize Apple's XCUITest framework, but I realize now I needed the xcuitest-driver and then I can just use the Mocha commands
[2016-12-19 11:13:50] <shabinmohan> Hi any one can tell what are the mandatory capabilities for iOS to run on real device?
[2016-12-19 11:42:25] <RatkoD> you cannot test iOS app using windows, just on mac
[2016-12-19 11:42:43] <RatkoD> you cannot do anything on Win for a iOS app
[2016-12-19 11:42:58] <shabinmohan> Exactly !
[2016-12-19 11:43:04] <RatkoD> you cannot develop on other then Mac

[2016-12-20 18:25:29] <blueice349> Does anyone know how I can run my automation test on more then one device at one time? I am using Appium 1.5.x and Mocha.
[2016-12-21 09:09:16] <RatkoD> blueice349: You can try the AppiumTestDistribution framework from@saikrishna321 [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-21 09:11:02] <RatkoD> it works fine with android devices and ios until 9.x version, but I have troubles making it work with iOS 10, Appium 1.6.x and xCode 8.2
[2016-12-22 20:00:45] <hardik-d> is anyone else facing this issue: [<-ISSUE->]
[2016-12-22 22:13:33] <jfricker> Hello. Anyone know when Appium will support Xcode 8.2?
[2016-12-22 23:14:17] <RatkoD> it supports
[2016-12-22 23:14:28] <RatkoD> install appium 1.6.3
[2016-12-23 12:06:36] <RatkoD> I would like to know if there is something else on the market. I've asked previously in this chat about Hive CI, but there was no response.
[2016-12-23 12:09:09] <shabinmohan> RatkoD: Yes
[2016-12-23 15:09:31] <jfricker> RatkoD: thank you!
[2016-12-24 16:18:56] <goldylucks> I just downloaded the sample code for nodejs and ran the simple test, and got an error.Filed an issue 12 days ago here: appium/appium#7510I'm wondering if there's anything I'm missing?or should I just wait for someone to attend the issue on GH?
[2016-12-24 16:36:33] <mgmanikandan87> goldylucks: i saw your log, could please post your code
[2016-12-24 16:53:56] <goldylucks> thanks@mgmanikandan87the code is posted in the issue
[2016-12-24 16:54:18] <goldylucks> u want me to copy paste all of it here?
[2016-12-24 16:54:22] <goldylucks> will b quite long ...
[2016-12-24 16:57:23] <mgmanikandan87> is this android ?
[2016-12-24 16:57:26] <mgmanikandan87> right ?
[2016-12-24 17:07:58] <goldylucks> mgmanikandan87: yes, ATM it's only android
[2016-12-25 03:37:32] <hardik-d> goldylucks: try adding appActivity and appWaitActivity capabilities, appium is clearly giving up after few tries to find element. What is happening during actual test run? is the app launched correctly?
[2016-12-26 17:36:16] <mbuckbee> I'm evaluating testing solutions and Appium seems great but there are a few things I haven't been able to figure out if it can do:
[2016-12-26 17:36:49] <mbuckbee> Can any app in an emulator be scripted, or does it have to be one that you're developing yourself?
[2016-12-26 17:37:52] <mbuckbee> Specifially, I'm trying to build a solution for testing how emails display in different email clients and would love to have an automated way to test against Apple Mail on iOS devices.
[2016-12-26 18:09:15] <danhdungads> 
[2016-12-26 19:16:47] <RatkoD> mbuckbee: you can interact only with your app, no other app can be used during the test.
[2016-12-26 19:20:10] <mbuckbee> RatkoD: I'm thinking that's some app restriction limitation and not specific to appium?
[2016-12-26 19:52:03] <RatkoD> the limitations come from apple
[2016-12-26 19:52:13] <mbuckbee> Yeah, that's what I figured.
[2016-12-26 19:56:48] <mbuckbee> So, to do this I'd either need to do click/swipe from an OSX mac or jailbreak (which I was trying to avoid).
[2016-12-26 20:14:05] <RatkoD> I think there is no cure for this, it's simple, apple would not allow you to interact with other apps
[2016-12-26 20:14:16] <RatkoD> not iven with clicking on coordinates
[2016-12-26 20:14:19] <RatkoD> or anything
[2016-12-26 20:14:32] <RatkoD> I don't know how jailbraking will help here
[2016-12-26 20:20:21] <mbuckbee> RatkoD: I found a couple listed solutions that were:
[2016-12-26 20:20:29] <mbuckbee> Jailbreak the device
[2016-12-26 20:20:35] <mbuckbee> Install a VNC client on the device
[2016-12-26 20:20:54] <mbuckbee> User our library to remotely run commands against the device
[2016-12-26 20:21:21] <mbuckbee> mbuckbee: also does not know how to do numbering in Gitter apparently
[2016-12-27 05:19:20] <ajit-jadhav> Hello All,
[2016-12-27 05:19:40] <ajit-jadhav> Is there any best tool to inspect native android UI ?
[2016-12-27 05:19:57] <ajit-jadhav> other than UI Automator viewer and Appium inspector.

[2016-12-28 12:30:49] <vfennerac> its kinda weird that we need team id and profile just to run browser tests
[2016-12-28 12:31:05] <vfennerac> thanks for the link and vid, will give it a try
[2016-12-28 12:38:50] <vfennerac> what if I don't have a team do give to appium?
[2016-12-28 12:39:05] <vfennerac> all I want to do is automated browser testing on the iphone
[2016-12-28 12:53:33] <RatkoD> Well, you should ask Apple for the logic. Their idea is that you need to pay for a dev account, you cannot develop without dev account, since you develop, you need to test the app, so for testing you need dev account.

[2016-12-29 13:42:31] <mgmanikandan87> no
[2016-12-29 13:42:34] <shabinmohan> it is for enter ?
[2016-12-29 13:42:36] <tfcardoso> swipe down :)
[2016-12-29 13:42:38] <mgmanikandan87> yes
[2016-12-29 13:42:54] <shabinmohan> ok...
[2016-12-29 13:43:28] <shabinmohan> instead of scroll I am usig swipe
[2016-12-29 13:43:47] <prabudakshan> swiping is the only option available
[2016-12-29 13:44:05] <sourcebits-siddesh> hmmm
[2016-12-29 13:44:05] <shabinmohan> if any of you know the beter scroll option in latest appium please suggest
[2016-12-29 13:44:13] <sourcebits-siddesh> yeah
[2016-12-29 13:44:23] <bakiko> mgmanikandan87: thank you. It is working!!!! 
[2016-12-29 13:44:56] <mgmanikandan87> cool
[2016-12-29 13:45:07] <mgmanikandan87> //XCUIElementTypeOther[3]/XCUIElementTypeOther
[2016-12-29 13:45:18] <mgmanikandan87> even this should work
[2016-12-29 13:45:20] <mgmanikandan87> try it
[2016-12-29 13:45:50] <prabudakshan> MobileElement ab=(MobileElement)dr.findElement(By.id("")); [<-CODE->] 
[2016-12-29 13:46:06] <prabudakshan> shabinmohan: this works a little bit you can try
[2016-12-29 13:46:24] <shabinmohan> prabudakshan: Sure let me try this one thanks
[2016-12-29 13:46:32] <prabudakshan> WC
[2016-12-29 13:46:44] <tfcardoso> Do not use driver.swipe. It was deprecated in Java 5.0
[2016-12-29 13:46:53] <tfcardoso> use TouchAction class
[2016-12-29 14:01:48] <sourcebits-siddesh> tfcardoso: for swipe
[2016-12-29 14:01:52] <sourcebits-siddesh> ?\
[2016-12-29 14:02:49] <tfcardoso> yes... you can do press().waitaction().moveTo().release().perform() p.e.
[2016-12-29 14:03:32] <tfcardoso> I still didn't adapt my code to it, but I'll have to change all the swipe, tap, zoom, pinch, etc. that I have
[2016-12-30 02:00:22] <Pastel001> set WebDriverWait timeout as 5s,why not give an exception?

[2016-12-30 02:05:28] <blueice349> does anyone know how to turn wifi off on iOS and Android? using appium 1.5.3 and Mocha ( javascript )
[2016-12-30 10:25:17] <ReaLau> Hi, there, anyone who use python nosetests framework?
[2016-12-30 10:36:08] <shabinmohan> Any of you have taken CMAP Mobile App Test Automation Certification ?
[2016-12-30 18:24:58] <blueice349> anyone know why appium 1.5.3 will not work with my android emulator? It worked prior to 1.5.3
[2016-12-31 07:52:32] <shabinmohan> blueice349: app is nnot launching ?
[2017-01-02 04:40:27] <blueice349> yes its not I have been trying to firgure out what is wrong
[2017-01-02 04:40:32] <blueice349> it works on Android Device
[2017-01-02 04:58:02] <shabinmohan> Iam  facing an issue to locate an //XCUIElementTypeStaticText elementI tried with different atribute values in relative xpath still not able to identify this elementwhen i printed the pagesourceI am not able to see this element in the xml  filesame time when inspecting through Appium-iOS-Inspector I am getting xpath for the same (which is not working)any of you faced any similer kind of issue ?
[2017-01-03 13:29:31] <mvanevery> hey everyone, will Appium 1.6.3 work with XCode 7.3.1? Or do I need to upgrade to XCode8?
[2017-01-04 00:49:18] <hardik-d> it should
[2017-01-04 00:49:39] <mvanevery> awesome. thank you
[2017-01-04 00:50:02] <hardik-d> don't use automationName XCUITest
[2017-01-04 00:50:09] <hardik-d> in your caps
[2017-01-04 00:50:46] <mvanevery> is that only for Xcode 8?
[2017-01-04 00:58:11] <hardik-d> yes
[2017-01-04 01:03:41] <mvanevery> awesome. I will remember that. thank you
[2017-01-04 11:00:26] <shabinmohan> Any of you know what are the check list we have  to go through before start iOS automation (mainly for inspecting elements) to find out nothing is missed or not followed proper development standards to name each and every element in app
[2017-01-04 11:01:28] <shabinmohan> from developers side
[2017-01-04 12:47:13] <guysegal> hi :)
[2017-01-04 12:47:26] <guysegal> I'm using appium 1.6 on real iOS 9 device
[2017-01-04 12:47:46] <guysegal> and the app launch twice for the appium session
[2017-01-04 12:48:06] <guysegal> is this the expected behaviour? I only call 'launch' once in my appium client
[2017-01-04 12:51:18] <siddu09> Hi guys
[2017-01-04 12:51:20] <siddu09> Automation step:A)Upload images from Gallery into Facebook album
[2017-01-04 12:51:55] <siddu09> Using  Mobile Browser can you guys give me some idea
[2017-01-04 12:51:58] <siddu09> ?
[2017-01-04 12:52:17] <siddu09> Android device, chrome browser
[2017-01-05 13:54:51] <forki> ok if noboday knows then another question: can I somehow exit a text input field?
[2017-01-05 17:38:09] <hardik-d> not clear@forkiwhat do you mean by exit a text input field
[2017-01-05 17:38:44] <hardik-d> click on a different element or some and you will exit
[2017-01-05 19:44:46] <guysegal> hiI'm using appium 1.6 on real iOS 9 deviceand the app launch twice for the appium sessionis this the expected 
[2017-01-05 20:04:51] <forki> hardik-d: yes but then I need to guess an element that has no action.
[2017-01-05 20:20:51] <RatkoD> no need to guess, click on some logo or picture or something. Not everything is clickable
[2017-01-05 20:21:40] <forki> ok - not exactly what I want but seems the only way
[2017-01-05 20:31:41] <hardik-d> yes, usually you enter some text and take some other action like submit a button or verify other elements etc.
[2017-01-05 20:32:43] <hardik-d> hope you are not trying to hide the keyboard or some
[2017-01-05 20:41:30] <forki> the problem with is that you need to click twice
[2017-01-05 20:41:54] <forki> at least when a text box has focus
[2017-01-05 20:53:21] <guysegal> is someone here using appium with react native? Does you experience difficulties getting elements by accessibility strategy? It seems that testID etc. behaves differently between iOS and Android
[2017-01-05 22:30:47] <SteffenL> Is Appium 1.6.3 supposed to be able to run multiple Android emulators concurrently assuming I use separate Appium server instances?
[2017-01-05 22:32:27] <SteffenL> Whenever I try to do it, Appium just cannot seem to handle it. For example, one server instance is supposed to handle one emulator but then it telnets into the other emulator or something.
[2017-01-05 22:32:50] <SteffenL> Maybe that's not even it, but it tries to do something with both emulators.
[2017-01-05 22:33:38] <SteffenL> Despite using different server ports, bootstrap ports, chromedriver ports, even UDID (whether it makes a difference or not)
[2017-01-05 22:35:04] <SteffenL> Not just that. I actually cannot even reliably run tests on two different emulators sequentially.
[2017-01-05 22:35:25] <SteffenL> Sometimes works, sometimes not
[2017-01-05 22:36:20] <SteffenL> All these problems lead me to think that Appium is not meant to support it, even through I have read various places that one can do it anyway.
[2017-01-05 22:42:34] <hardik-d> i used to do it previously
[2017-01-05 22:42:47] <hardik-d> haven't tried on 1.6.3
[2017-01-05 22:43:21] <hardik-d> "Despite using different server ports, bootstrap ports, chromedriver ports, even UDID (whether it makes a difference or not)" this is must
[2017-01-05 22:47:53] <hardik-d> $ appium -p 4754 -bp 4756 -U "192.168.56.101:5555" --chromedriver-port 9527// -p is appium port, -bp is bootstrap port, -U is UDID for emulators, --chromedriver-port// to get UDID for genymotion emulators, launch desired emulator then type below:$ adb devices// finally launch tests by passing in additional params$ PORT=4754 UDID=192.168.56.101:5555 PLATFORM=android rspec -b appium_test
[2017-01-05 22:47:56] <SteffenL> Thanks for replying
[2017-01-05 22:48:11] <hardik-d> this is what has worked before
[2017-01-05 22:48:21] <hardik-d> check the ports i am using
[2017-01-05 22:48:38] <hardik-d> they have to be 10# apart from one instance to another
[2017-01-05 22:49:39] <SteffenL> Hmm. Isn't -U the same as --udid ?
[2017-01-05 22:49:57] <hardik-d> ofcourse i use UDID and PORT in my caps
[2017-01-05 22:50:25] <SteffenL> Sorry
[2017-01-05 22:50:38] <hardik-d> yes but you start your server and tell it the UDID and have to tell your test code the same
[2017-01-05 22:50:57] <SteffenL> When I run my tests, I have emulators with UDID "emulator-5554" and "emulator-5556". How do I know what to tell Appium?
[2017-01-05 22:51:37] <SteffenL> Or does the parameter set the UDID in the emulator as well?
[2017-01-05 22:52:19] <hardik-d> in ruby
[2017-01-05 22:55:04] <SteffenL> Hmm. Not sure what that appium_lib is so I will check that out. Maybe I could just put the UDID inside my "default-capabilities.json" file?
[2017-01-05 22:55:08] <hardik-d> so basically you have to tell your driver to talk to which port
[2017-01-05 22:55:59] <hardik-d> figure ^^ out in whatever appium client lib you are using
[2017-01-05 22:56:16] <hardik-d> you using java/python/js?
[2017-01-05 22:56:21] <SteffenL> Python
[2017-01-05 22:56:39] <SteffenL> I tried to set the UDID to something random so maybe that is the problem.
[2017-01-05 22:56:40] <hardik-d> k
[2017-01-05 22:57:15] <SteffenL> I just do not know what/who decides what the UDID of the emulator will be.
[2017-01-05 22:57:25] <SteffenL> If it's Appium then maybe it will work.
[2017-01-05 22:57:36] <hardik-d> server has to know exact UDID to talk to and your driver  has to know what UDID and appium port to talk to
[2017-01-05 22:57:57] <hardik-d> UDID is unique per device/emulator
[2017-01-05 22:58:03] <hardik-d> has nothing to do with appium
[2017-01-05 22:58:16] <SteffenL> So maybe it's set when I create the AVD then
[2017-01-05 22:58:21] <hardik-d> yes
[2017-01-05 22:58:22] <SteffenL> Okay I will try :D
[2017-01-05 22:58:31] <hardik-d> if your emulator/avd is running
[2017-01-05 22:58:44] <hardik-d> typing adb devices should give you the UDID
[2017-01-05 22:59:51] <SteffenL> Thank you, Hardik! I will be right back. Need to switch from Windows to macOS where I do the development/testing.
[2017-01-05 23:06:07] <SteffenL> Hmm. I do not think it worked out the way I expected.
[2017-01-05 23:07:42] <SteffenL> I launched one emulator (Android 5.1) andadb devicesgave me "emulator-5554". Then I quit the emulator and launched another one (Android 7.1). This time,adb devicesalso gave me "emulator-5554".
[2017-01-05 23:09:28] <SteffenL> If I then start up the first emulator again (Android 5.1), its UDID appears to be "emulator-5556".
[2017-01-05 23:10:31] <SteffenL> I don't know but maybe this is a problem for Appium?
[2017-01-05 23:14:37] <SteffenL> I have an idea. I can try to use the avdArgs capability to pass the "-port" parameter to the emulator. "Set the console port number for this emulator instance to <port>. The console port number must be an even integer between 5554 and 5584, inclusive. <port>+1 must also be free and will be reserved for adb."
[2017-01-05 23:15:08] <SteffenL> That may make the UDID consistent at least.
[2017-01-06 04:41:39] <SteffenL> In the end, I decided to create an issue on GitHub: [<-ISSUE->]
[2017-01-06 10:14:21] <forki> guysegal: so testID has an observable effect for appium for you? I set it for a couple of images in my react native android  app and appium pagesource didn't change at all. How is this supposed to work?
[2017-01-06 11:34:31] <guysegal> forki: I'm adding these properties to the component props:
[2017-01-06 11:34:31] <guysegal> { testID: testID, accessible:true, accessibilityLabel:testID }
[2017-01-06 11:35:04] <guysegal> in android it works in most of the places you'll put it. I'm having difficulties to understand how it works is iOS
[2017-01-06 11:35:31] <guysegal> a component that have these props is reachable by appium android, but not always in appium ios
[2017-01-06 11:35:39] <guysegal> I'm probably doing something wrong
[2017-01-06 11:35:47] <guysegal> Anyone ever executed test with two android devices connected to the same appium server? I'm getting this error message:
[2017-01-06 11:36:45] <guysegal> "A new session could not be created. Details: Problem getting session data for driver type AndroidDriver; does it implement 'get driverData'?"
[2017-01-06 11:37:15] <guysegal> the weird thing is that the same test with iOS & Android devices connected runs successfully
[2017-01-06 11:43:50] <forki> guysegal: how do you find that element after that in appium? what is your selector?
[2017-01-06 12:00:41] <guysegal> yes I am. I'm using accessibility selector
[2017-01-06 12:22:12] <forki> no xpath?
[2017-01-06 12:22:36] <forki> I always thought testID would somehow map to a resource-id
[2017-01-06 21:09:34] <reywinters03> is anyone using appium with node? i can't seem to getbrowser.execute('mobile:scroll', {'direction':'down'})to work ...
[2017-01-06 21:10:16] <reywinters03> i tried using touchAction but it says it's not yet implemented
[2017-01-06 21:10:16] <reywinters03> i tried using touchAction but it says it's not yet implemented
[2017-01-06 21:44:37] <hardik-d> none of touch action is implemented?
[2017-01-06 21:44:49] <hardik-d> or a particular touchaction method isn't
[2017-01-06 21:45:16] <hardik-d> i don't use node js with appium but use ruby instead
[2017-01-06 21:45:44] <hardik-d> and always use touchaction class for scrolling
[2017-01-06 21:59:54] <reywinters03> i tried [<-CODE->]
[2017-01-06 22:00:05] <reywinters03> i get an error saying not yet implemented
[2017-01-06 22:10:34] <reywinters03> and then when i tried using mobile: scroll i'm gettingUnexpected error in -[UIAScrollView_
[2017-01-06 23:04:05] <hardik-d> Appium::TouchAction.new.press(x: 100, y: 200).move_to(x: 100, y: -200).release.perform ruby code works for me

[2017-01-17 19:28:52] <propaul> Hi guys, i have appium 1.5.3 installed in my Mac, i had created an iOS simulator for iPhone 5 with version 9.3 using Xcode 7.3.1 and i was able to launch the web app i had put in my script.  When i updated to Xcode 8.2.1 the simulator would not launch nor run script
[2017-01-17 19:30:38] <propaul> I also cannot execute any tests using real iOS device, is there certain steps i have to take using the developer id for real iOS device to work?
[2017-01-17 19:31:14] <Edge-Man> You cannot use Xcode 8.2.1 with Appium 1.5.3
[2017-01-17 19:31:32] <Edge-Man> Xcode 8.0 + replaced the instrumentation with XCtests......
[2017-01-17 19:31:37] <hardik-d> upgrade to appium 1.6.3
[2017-01-17 19:31:47] <Edge-Man> ^ +++
[2017-01-17 19:32:12] <propaul> would i be able to test on my real device using 1.6.3 and Xcode 8.2.1?
[2017-01-17 19:32:32] <Edge-Man> yeah, but it's going to take a bit of updating to get there
[2017-01-17 19:32:51] <Edge-Man> This video does a good job telling you what to do: [<-LINK->]
[2017-01-17 19:33:53] <propaul> is 1.6.3 available on appium.io for Mac?
[2017-01-17 19:34:08] <Edge-Man> Yes and no..
[2017-01-17 19:34:33] <Edge-Man> as of Appium 1.6.0, there is no .dmg you have to run everything via command line.
[2017-01-17 19:35:14] <propaul> what if i used xcdoe 7
[2017-01-17 19:35:35] <Edge-Man> Then appium 1.5.3 will work
[2017-01-17 19:35:47] <Edge-Man> but you wont be able to target a iOS 10 device
[2017-01-17 19:36:14] <propaul> would it support iOS 10.2?
[2017-01-17 19:36:45] <Edge-Man> nope.
[2017-01-17 19:36:56] <Edge-Man> anything iOS 10 + requires Xcode 8.0 +
[2017-01-17 19:37:04] <propaul> once the iOS updates to latest version, is it possible to downgrade?
[2017-01-17 19:37:11] <Edge-Man> nope.
[2017-01-17 19:37:20] <Edge-Man> Well, I sorta lied.
[2017-01-17 19:38:17] <propaul> do i have to setup the certificate and provisioning through apple developer site for all this to work?
[2017-01-17 19:38:30] <Edge-Man> You can downgrade, but you have a very short window to do it. Basically, Apple's activation server removes the older iOS version. I cannot remember if it is immediate or it's a few days.
[2017-01-17 19:39:27] <Edge-Man> I believe you do need a developer team account to get it all working. I'm not sure. Perhaps someone could answer that for you.
[2017-01-17 19:39:32] <propaul> thats fine ill just leave it at 10.2...i enabled the UI automation
[2017-01-17 19:40:27] <propaul> yea my company got the dev team id, i just have to figure out a way to make the script run on real device
[2017-01-17 19:41:11] <propaul> i have the android real device setup, iOS seems a little more tricky
[2017-01-17 19:41:32] <propaul> cool, thnx, ill check it out
[2017-01-17 20:20:29] <propaul> can anyone give me a link to download appium 1.6.3 it's not showing as an option in the appium.io site
[2017-01-17 20:21:37] <hardik-d> there is none
[2017-01-17 20:22:00] <hardik-d> that is what@Edge-Manmeant when he said there is no dmg
[2017-01-17 20:25:23] <propaul> so is there way of downloading it?
[2017-01-17 20:35:06] <hardik-d> npm
[2017-01-17 20:35:54] <hardik-d>  [<-LINK->]
[2017-01-18 09:57:41] <puneetbohra> what kind of dependencies i need to install to run Android Web test cases on Appium 1.6.3?
[2017-01-18 09:57:48] <jeevanbhushetty> any idea how can I locate an element on different android version which has only "content-desc" attribute
[2017-01-18 09:58:20] <coding-yogi> long time since I worked on appium, does content-desc map to name or to text?
[2017-01-18 09:59:40] <jeevanbhushetty> I tried googling it says name..
[2017-01-18 09:59:52] <jeevanbhushetty> by which I was unable to locate using name
[2017-01-18 10:01:49] <coding-yogi> worst case u can always try npm uninstall and then npm install
[2017-01-18 10:02:00] <coding-yogi> it will just reinstall all the dependencies
[2017-01-18 10:03:33] <sanojqa> driver.findelement(by.name() not supporting in the latest appium. Heve any alternative to this?
[2017-01-18 10:11:53] <priyankshah217> use accessibility id instead of name
[2017-01-18 10:12:13] <sanojqa> how can we write any sample?
[2017-01-18 10:12:32] <sanojqa> driver.findelement(by.name("login")).click();
[2017-01-18 10:13:31] <priyankshah217> driver.findElementByAccessibilityId("Login").click();
[2017-01-18 10:24:08] <coding-yogi> name should ideally work
[2017-01-18 10:24:10] <coding-yogi>  [<-LINK->]
[2017-01-18 10:24:52] <coding-yogi> what I can make out from this code is in case of Name, it searches by Content description and text as well
[2017-01-18 10:26:33] <coding-yogi> sanojqa: do you see any error if you use name?
[2017-01-18 10:26:47] <coding-yogi> or its just that appium doesn't find the required element?
[2017-01-18 10:37:35] <coding-yogi> got it
[2017-01-18 10:37:46] <coding-yogi> appium now uses UiAutomator2
[2017-01-18 10:37:56] <coding-yogi>  [<-LINK->]
[2017-01-18 10:38:14] <coding-yogi> this seems to be the current code, the one I posted above is the old one
[2017-01-18 10:38:23] <coding-yogi> I dnt see any by.Name here
[2017-01-18 10:38:34] <coding-yogi> and the error matches what you have mentioned
[2017-01-18 10:38:36] <sanojqa> is this work for iOS? 
[2017-01-18 10:38:36] <sanojqa> is this work for iOS? 
[2017-01-18 10:42:03] <sanojqa> name not working for iOS, actually I got the issue for iOS
[2017-01-18 10:44:08] <coding-yogi> I see it for old ios driver [<-LINK->]
[2017-01-18 10:44:43] <coding-yogi> but I guess new version uses appium-xcuitest-driver ??
[2017-01-18 10:45:16] <sanojqa> am using appium 1.5.3 and locator 'name'
[2017-01-18 10:45:26] <sanojqa> its not working
[2017-01-18 10:45:57] <coding-yogi> I am not sure what appium 1.5.3 uses, I assume it is using appium-xcuitest-driver
[2017-01-18 10:46:05] <coding-yogi> haven't worked on appium for long time
[2017-01-18 10:46:30] <sanojqa> aniket-21: ok fine, Thanks for the response
[2017-01-18 10:48:06] <coding-yogi> i.6.0 should be using appium-xcuitest-driver as per the changelog [<-LINK->]
[2017-01-18 10:48:13] <coding-yogi> 1.6.0*
[2017-01-18 10:49:11] <coding-yogi> so ideally Name should work
[2017-01-18 10:49:32] <sanojqa> aniket-21: fin
[2017-01-18 10:49:33] <sanojqa> e
[2017-01-18 10:49:40] <priyankshah217> check java-client library
[2017-01-18 10:52:48] <coding-yogi> java-client lob should have it else his code won't compile, right?

[2017-01-18 10:58:15] <coding-yogi> sanojqa: , u can try something like findElementByIosUIAutomation("au.getElementByName('somename')")
[2017-01-18 10:58:44] <sanojqa> aniket-21: let me try and update you
[2017-01-18 10:59:36] <coding-yogi> also it would be good to see appium log when u get the error for name
[2017-01-18 10:59:41] <coding-yogi> would be helpful to debug
[2017-01-19 06:49:00] <puneetbohra> Does Appium 1.6.3 support parralel test for IOS APPS.
[2017-01-20 10:49:12] <coding-yogi> The problem I faced with Protractor is, as soon as it invokes app, it immediately tries to inject protractor javascript into webview
[2017-01-20 10:49:55] <coding-yogi> in cases of splash screen or 1st screen as native screen, injection of protractor script fails due to absence of any webview
[2017-01-20 10:50:18] <coding-yogi> if you can dump the appium log here, that would be helpful
[2017-01-20 10:51:04] <jeevanbhushetty> Same thing I was am facing.. I added caps.setCapability("appWaitActivity", "your Main activity name");
[2017-01-20 10:51:49] <jeevanbhushetty> but this is for java + appium not sure if you can do it in protractor..
[2017-01-20 10:52:08] <coding-yogi> what do u get in the server log?
[2017-01-20 10:55:49] <jeevanbhushetty>  [<-CODE->] It was stopping server at launch.. and it was random...
[2017-01-20 10:56:25] <jeevanbhushetty> sometime it used to launch app successfully and sometimes it was showing me above issue..

[2017-01-25 13:24:11] <coding-yogi> Hw r u scrolling
[2017-01-25 13:24:21] <coding-yogi> What does appium log say when u scroll
[2017-01-25 13:31:56] <mvanevery> I am working through a webdriverio framework and using appium through that. the only thing I see in the appium log is -
[2017-01-25 13:32:06] <mvanevery> [<-CODE->] 501 2 ms - 112
[2017-01-25 13:36:35] <coding-yogi> What is the response code 501?
[2017-01-25 13:39:03] <mvanevery> apparently its an HTTP protocal issue meaning "not implemented"
[2017-01-25 13:39:14] <mvanevery> I will have to look further into this
[2017-01-25 13:40:55] <coding-yogi> Ya cos scroll is no more there
[2017-01-25 13:41:00] <coding-yogi> U shud use swipe
[2017-01-25 13:59:22] <mvanevery> ah. I will try that then
[2017-01-25 14:49:02] <ckilesse-daitan> Hello, all!I'm having some trouble trying to scale my Appium tests and I'm interested in hearing from people who are running multiple Appium servers for running tests in parallel.My initial idea was to run appium on Docker on cloud machines for Android but that didn't work since I was only able to run arm on cloud and it's too slow for my needs. For iOS I didn't come up with anything other than handling multiple machines/devices myself or paying for a solution like SauceLabs.Has anyone solved this in another way and can share how you are doing it?
[2017-01-25 15:14:15] <RatkoD> try this [<-LINK->]
[2017-01-25 16:15:04] <ckilesse-daitan> This looks good, but it seems to solve the issue of running the same tests across multiple different devices. My goal is to actually speed up the test execution by parallelizing the execution of a same test suite across multiple appium servers.
[2017-01-25 16:16:53] <ckilesse-daitan> We have about 300 jbehave tests using Appium and they are taking near 7 hours to complete and this is just too much. BTW, does this look reasonable to you guys? 300 Appium tests in 7 hours?
[2017-01-25 17:37:45] <hardik-d> i had file an appium support issue where on ios after upgrading to XCUITestDriver my test runtime has more than doubled
[2017-01-25 17:38:28] <hardik-d> i have around 100 tests which take almost 3 hours on ios so 300 tests in 7 hoursaligns along those lines
[2017-01-25 17:38:51] <hardik-d> android is much faster though
[2017-01-25 17:39:04] <hardik-d> earlier android used to be hella slow
[2017-01-25 17:40:15] <hardik-d> i don't know of any solution for ios other than what you are doing with multiple machines, OS limitation i guess

[2017-01-25 21:32:30] <cbiermannIMVU> I'm trying to get the appium software and the appium doctor is giving me the following error.nfo AppiumDoctor ### Diagnostic starting ###info AppiumDoctor   Xcode is installed at: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer[Error: Could not detect Mac OS X Version from sw_vers output: '10.12.2']
[2017-01-25 21:33:11] <cbiermannIMVU> appium Version 1.5.3 (Ara)
[2017-01-25 21:33:22] <Edge-Man> which xcode version are you using?
[2017-01-25 21:35:47] <cbiermannIMVU> V 8.2.1
[2017-01-25 21:36:11] <Edge-Man> need to use appium 1.6.3
[2017-01-25 21:36:50] <Edge-Man>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-25 21:43:15] <cbiermannIMVU> I don't see 1.6.3 on the appium bitbucket account
[2017-01-25 21:54:43] <cbiermannIMVU> appium is 1.6.3 if I install via the terminal but the desktop app is still 1.5.3
[2017-01-25 21:55:11] <Edge-Man> yeah, there's no .dmg for Appium 1.6.3, this is something the guys are working on
[2017-01-25 21:55:13] <Edge-Man> so..
[2017-01-25 21:55:20] <Edge-Man> you have to install it via command line
[2017-01-25 21:55:31] <cbiermannIMVU> kk
[2017-01-25 21:55:49] <hardik-d> cbiermannIMVU: appium does not support sierra
[2017-01-25 21:55:54] <hardik-d> you are on sierra
[2017-01-25 21:56:16] <hardik-d> downgrade to mac os 10.11
[2017-01-25 21:57:13] <Edge-Man> Appium 1.6.3 works for me with Sierra
[2017-01-25 21:57:34] <Edge-Man> but I think what hardik is saying that Appium 1.5.3 doesnt work with Sierra?
[2017-01-25 21:59:25] <Edge-Man> and it wont work with Xcode 8.2.1  because apple remove the old instrumentation that drives it, so it shouldn't work. So if you want to use appium 1.6.3, you have to roll back Mac OS to 10.11 and roll back to an older version of Xcode =  Xcode 8.0 pre.  and you wont be able to test on iOS 10
[2017-01-25 22:03:08] <cbiermannIMVU> Got it
[2017-01-26 00:54:36] <hardik-d> Edge-Man: i have seen folks complaining about 1.6.3 not working on sierra
[2017-01-26 00:54:46] <hardik-d> hence hesitant to upgrade
[2017-01-26 00:55:23] <hardik-d> did you upgrade from el cap to sierra or was it a brand new machine?
[2017-01-26 00:57:17] <mkulava> Guys, is it possible to automate application written in Swift 3 using Appium? I've been told that Appium can interact only with objective c apps
[2017-01-26 01:11:14] <coding-yogi> I hv automated swift apps ,not sure about swift 3 in specific
[2017-01-26 01:15:24] <mkulava> aniket-21: thanks for your answer
[2017-01-26 08:55:33] <RatkoD> I think it doesn't matter which language is used to write the app, either way, appium does not require anythin to be implemented in the app so the automation will work, unlike some other frameworks
[2017-01-26 08:56:00] <RatkoD> appium uses apple testing framework, now XCUItest
[2017-01-26 10:19:10] <mkulava> RatkoD: so it is possible to run tests on iOS 10 and it is compatibel with XCode 8 now?
[2017-01-26 10:48:54] <hazmeister> mkulava: it is indeed, with the capability automationName : XCUITest
[2017-01-26 10:51:03] <mkulava> hazmeister: great news, thank you
[2017-01-26 14:28:39] <RatkoD> yes, just to confirm, but it's a very complicated setup
[2017-01-26 14:28:44] <RatkoD> very very complicated
[2017-01-26 14:28:46] <RatkoD> very
[2017-01-26 14:58:13] <hazmeister> anyone updated to the new itunes?  I have a suspicion its broke appium’s ability to talk to safari on real devices
[2017-01-26 17:28:41] <hardik-d> i haven't, its knocking on the door
[2017-01-27 10:12:31] <RatkoD> Hey guys, does anyone knows a solution for the Too many instances of this service are already running error
[2017-01-27 10:12:54] <RatkoD> it happens all the time, even after just a few tests, and I need to reboot the tested device
[2017-01-27 10:13:17] <RatkoD> and it's a pain in the ass to do this all the time
[2017-01-27 10:14:29] <RatkoD> or nobody here is using appium 1.6+ because it's actually unusable with all the bugs and things not working
[2017-01-30 18:23:25] <mmcintyre123> Hi All, I'm having trouble with Appium 1.6.3, Xcode 8.2.1, and iOS 10.2.  I installed the new iOS driver XCUITest and now I am trying to get my tests to run in an iPad Air 2 simulator - or really any iOS 10+ simulator.  The simulator pops up, the new WebDriverAgent appears to start, but my app WILL NOT launch.  It tries to, but closes immediately.  I've tried almost everything and sort of at a loss.  Will post more details momentarily about how I built the app and appium logs.  If anyone can help though I would appreciate it!!
[2017-01-30 18:25:07] <mmcintyre123> Icanlaunch the app in the simulator from within Xcode, which is strange.  So I am wondering if there is some conflict or incorrect setup of the new automation drivers...
[2017-01-30 18:35:23] <mmcintyre123> My OS is El Capitan 10.11.6

[2017-01-30 22:16:54] <propaul> Does anyone know what steps do i have to take to launch a website from safari in iOS devices? do i have to download a safari extension?
[2017-01-30 22:17:29] <propaul> package demos;import org.openqa.selenium.By;import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;import org.openqa.selenium.safari.SafariDriver;public class Test4 { [<-CODE->] }
[2017-01-30 22:17:54] <Edge-Man> are you testing a native iOS app or Web application on iOS?
[2017-01-30 22:17:56] <propaul> this doesn't seem to work
[2017-01-30 22:18:04] <propaul> web app
[2017-01-30 22:18:41] <Edge-Man> here you go: [<-LINK->]
[2017-01-30 22:20:01] <propaul> would this work for appium 1.6.3 and iOS version 10.2?
[2017-01-30 22:21:26] <propaul> WebDriver driver = new SafariDriver();driver.get(" [<-LINK->] ");
[2017-01-30 22:21:41] <propaul> would i still have to input this into my script?
[2017-01-30 22:22:15] <Edge-Man> here an example from  the link I posted: [<-CODE->]
[2017-01-30 22:24:12] <propaul> would it be same for real device? i just have to input udid # and change the iOS version?
[2017-01-30 22:26:42] <Edge-Man> the code yes, but there's a setup process that is different the instructions are listed in the link I provided. If you read through it, it should have everything you need to know.

[2017-02-02 08:38:52] <yozzz06_twitter> anyone familiar with selenium grid?
[2017-02-02 09:19:45] <coding-yogi> what's your query@yozzz06_twitter
[2017-02-02 09:28:57] <yozzz06_twitter> so i have selenium grid plugin installed in Jenkins which is on machine A (Unix), i have nodes on machine B (unix) and machine C (windows) . If i start the node for the Machine B (Unix) it's all ok. But if i start then and the node on Machine C (Windows), something is happening because i can't even acces the URL/grid/console
[2017-02-02 09:30:35] <coding-yogi> what log do u see on grid server (machine A) when you start windows node (Machine C)
[2017-02-02 09:32:54] <yozzz06_twitter> channel stopped
[2017-02-02 09:33:06] <yozzz06_twitter> here is the node log: [<-LINK->]
[2017-02-02 09:33:39] <yozzz06_twitter> i don't understand why the windows machine causing this...all the machine are in the same VPN

[2017-02-02 09:36:24] <yozzz06_twitter> the linux node connects and is registered to the hub...it's everything good..the windows node is giving me a headache

[2017-02-02 09:37:16] <coding-yogi> aren't you doing anything after node is connected?
[2017-02-02 09:42:08] <yozzz06_twitter> nope..:|
[2017-02-02 09:42:17] <yozzz06_twitter> only hit start from jenkins and that's all
[2017-02-02 09:42:34] <coding-yogi> what I meant is
[2017-02-02 09:42:44] <coding-yogi> r u not running any tests on this node
[2017-02-02 09:43:14] <yozzz06_twitter> nope
[2017-02-02 09:43:22] <yozzz06_twitter> i only want to establish the connection
[2017-02-02 09:43:54] <yozzz06_twitter> DefaultRemoteProxy unknown version this is from the grind/console
[2017-02-02 09:49:20] <coding-yogi> how is the log looking on node
[2017-02-02 09:49:26] <coding-yogi> can u paste node log?
[2017-02-06 06:19:55] <archana-nagaraj> Hello guys, has anybody worked with zephyr for automation ?  I have written appium scripts in java in android studio and I want to trigger them from Jira via zephyr plugin . Any help ?
[2017-02-06 08:06:41] <imranreee> i'm trying to scroll up the page of a android application, i'm using below method, but its not working, is there any other way ?
[2017-02-06 08:06:44] <imranreee> public void scrollPageUp() {JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;HashMap<String, Double> swipeObject = new HashMap<String, Double>();swipeObject.put("startX", 0.50);swipeObject.put("startY", 0.95);swipeObject.put("endX", 0.50);swipeObject.put("endY", 0.01);swipeObject.put("duration", 3.0);js.executeScript("mobile: swipe", swipeObject);}
[2017-02-06 08:07:30] <imranreee> error log: org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Not yet implemented. Please help us: [<-LINK->] (WARNING: The server did not provide any stacktrace information)
[2017-02-06 08:11:14] <coding-yogi> Mobile: swipe is not a valid implementation
[2017-02-06 08:11:38] <coding-yogi> Support for such actions was removed long back
[2017-02-06 08:11:52] <coding-yogi> Why r u using execute script for swiping
[2017-02-06 08:40:20] <imranreee> aniket-21: so, could you please tell me which method i can use?
[2017-02-06 09:00:00] <coding-yogi>  [<-LINK->]
[2017-02-06 09:02:07] <imranreee> Thanks, Let me check.@aniket-21
[2017-02-06 09:08:04] <imranreee> which method i have to call for page scroll up?
[2017-02-06 09:08:13] <imranreee> SwipeElementDirection    this one ???
[2017-02-06 09:08:45] <coding-yogi> swipeElementDirection is class name
[2017-02-06 09:10:02] <imranreee> swipe   ?  from 202 line ?
[2017-02-06 09:10:21] <coding-yogi> yes
[2017-02-06 09:10:50] <imranreee> and for left and right swiping ?
[2017-02-06 09:13:15] <coding-yogi> offset determines the direct
[2017-02-06 09:13:18] <coding-yogi> direction
[2017-02-06 09:14:09] <imranreee> sorry, i didn't get you ?
[2017-02-06 09:15:11] <coding-yogi> see the code
[2017-02-06 09:15:12] <coding-yogi> int startX = getStartX(p, location, size, offset1);int startY = getStartY(p, location, size, offset1);int endX = getEndX(p, location, size, offset2);int endY = getEndY(p, location, size, offset2);
[2017-02-06 09:16:35] <coding-yogi> although I am finding this code little weird
[2017-02-06 09:17:23] <imranreee> that means swipe method for all (scroll up, left swiping and right swiping )
[2017-02-06 09:18:46] <coding-yogi> my bad
[2017-02-06 09:18:51] <coding-yogi> don't use that code
[2017-02-06 09:18:56] <coding-yogi> use touch actions
[2017-02-06 09:18:58] <coding-yogi>  [<-LINK->]
[2017-02-06 09:20:06] <coding-yogi> because where ever there is swipe code, I see the comment that its deprecated and will be removed
[2017-02-06 09:20:25] <coding-yogi> better to use touchActions than breaking your code at later point of time
[2017-02-06 09:23:40] <imranreee> Thanks a lot@aniket-21for you replay
